CAMEMBERT_START_DOCSTRING = r"""

    This model inherits from :class:`~transformers.TFPreTrainedModel`. Check the superclass documentation for the
    generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input
    embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

    This model is also a `tf.keras.Model <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model>`__ subclass.
    Use it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general
    usage and behavior.

    .. note::

        TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

        - having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
        - having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

        This second option is useful when using :meth:`tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having
        all the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: :obj:`model(inputs)`.

        If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors
        in the first positional argument :

        - a single Tensor with :obj:`input_ids` only and nothing else: :obj:`model(inputs_ids)`
        - a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
          :obj:`model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or :obj:`model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
        - a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
          :obj:`model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.CamembertConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration.
            Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model weights.
